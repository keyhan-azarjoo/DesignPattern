# DesignPattern

In software development, programmers often encounter recurring problems, and design patterns offer solutions to these challenges. A design pattern isn't code itself but rather a structured approach that developers use to address common issues. These patterns provide frameworks or implementation structures that aid in the creation of more efficient and maintainable software.

# Types of Design Patterns:
There are three primary types of design patterns:

# Creational Patterns: 
These patterns assist in the instantiation of classes or objects based on specific patterns or conditions.

# Structural Patterns: 
Structural design patterns focus on organizing classes and objects to manage complexity effectively, enhancing flexibility and relationships between components.

# Behavioral Patterns:
Behavioral patterns aim to improve the interaction and communication between classes, defining how objects collaborate and distribute responsibilities within a system.

# Overview of Key Patterns:
Let's explore some useful design patterns:

# Singleton (Creational):
The Singleton pattern restricts the instantiation of a class to only one object. It's beneficial when you need precisely one instance of a class throughout your application. For example, in database handling scenarios, having multiple instances of a connection class might lead to issues. By implementing the Singleton pattern, you ensure that only one instance is created and accessed globally.
 
# Builder (Creational):
In complex projects, managing the construction of objects can become intricate. The Builder pattern allows you to construct complex objects step by step, providing a clear and organized approach to object creation. This pattern is particularly useful when dealing with objects with numerous configuration options or parameters.

# Decorator (Structural):
Software often requires manipulation and transformation of data to fulfill various requirements. The Decorator pattern enables the dynamic alteration or enhancement of object behavior without affecting other instances of the same class. For instance, in a pizza ordering system, instead of creating separate classes for every possible combination of pizza toppings, the Decorator pattern allows for the dynamic addition of toppings to base pizza objects.

# Strategy (Behavioral):
The Strategy pattern separates the behavior of an object from the object itself, allowing for interchangeable behaviors at runtime. This pattern promotes flexibility and extensibility by encapsulating algorithms and strategies within individual classes. For example, in a pizza-making application, different strategies can be employed for preparing dough or selecting sauces, allowing for easy modification or addition of new strategies without altering the core functionality.

# Implementation Examples:
Each pattern comes with a detailed implementation example to demonstrate its usage and benefits. Refer to the respective directories or provided code samples to explore further.
